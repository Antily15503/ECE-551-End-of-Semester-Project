root issue: only 'xx' is being written to ch1dump.txt
	
	-the TX wire in LA_dig.sv briefly goes to state xx
	- cmd_cfg briefly reads rdataCH1 (which is xx) and sets resp to xx as a result


	ALL DATA CHANNELS ARE XX BECAUSE:
	- the write enable is never high for the RAMqueues
	- the capture.sv SM never enters the write state which would set 'we' high
	- the "run" input is never set to trigger it to enter the write state
	- TrigCfg[4] = run is never equal to 1, which is set in cmd_cfg

TrigCfg[4] can only be set to 1 if in cmd_cfg cmd[13:8] ==0, and cmd[4] == 1

is this an issue with cmd not being properly set? is this cmd_cfg not checking for the right
